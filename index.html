            <h2>Problem statement: Job Application Frustrations</h2>
            <p>
                Many job applications require applicants to manually type fields such as work history in 
                addition to requiring a resume. Students who are applying to many jobs or internships find
                re-typing their resume frustrating and time consuming.
